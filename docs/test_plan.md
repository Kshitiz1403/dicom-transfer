## 2. Integration Tests

### Upload Mode Tests
- Test uploading a single DICOM study
- Test uploading multiple DICOM studies
- Test uploading mixed DICOM and non-DICOM files
- Test error handling for invalid source paths
- Test upload resumption after failure

### Download Mode Tests
- Test downloading a study by UID
- Test error handling for non-existent studies
- Test download to existing vs. new directories
- Test concurrent downloads of multiple studies

### AWS Integration Tests
- Test end-to-end upload to real S3 bucket
- Test end-to-end download from real S3 bucket
- Test metadata storage in real DynamoDB table
- Test cleanup of temporary files

## 3. Performance Tests

### Single-threaded Performance
- Measure upload speed for different file sizes
- Measure download speed for different file sizes
- Measure metadata processing time

### Multi-threaded Performance
- Compare performance with different thread counts
- Measure CPU and memory utilization
- Identify optimal thread count for different network conditions
- Test concurrent uploads and downloads

### Scalability Tests
- Test with large DICOM studies (>1000 files)
- Test with large file sizes (>100MB per file)
- Test DynamoDB performance with large metadata sets

## 4. Security Tests

### Encryption Tests
- Verify TLS encryption for S3 uploads
- Verify TLS encryption for S3 downloads
- Verify server-side encryption for stored files

### Authentication Tests
- Test AWS credential handling
- Test behavior with invalid credentials
- Test behavior with insufficient permissions

## 5. Error Recovery Tests

### Network Failure Tests
- Test behavior during network interruptions
- Test retry mechanisms for failed uploads
- Test retry mechanisms for failed downloads

### Resource Limit Tests
- Test behavior when disk space is insufficient
- Test behavior when memory is constrained
- Test behavior when DynamoDB throughput is exceeded

## 6. Validation Strategy

1. **Automated Tests**
   - Unit tests will be implemented using Google Test framework
   - Integration tests will be implemented using Python scripts
   - Performance tests will use custom profiling tools

2. **Manual Testing**
   - Command-line interface usability testing
   - End-to-end workflow validation
   - Installation testing on different Ubuntu versions

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - All unit tests will run on every commit
   - Integration tests will run nightly
   - Performance benchmarks will be tracked over time

## 7. Test Environment

- **Development Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS with DCMTK and AWS SDK installed
- **Test Data**: Anonymized DICOM datasets of various sizes
- **AWS Resources**: Test S3 bucket and DynamoDB table in isolated AWS account
- **Network**: Both high-speed local network and throttled connections for testing
