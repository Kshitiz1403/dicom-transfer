# DICOM Transfer Utility - User Stories & Time Estimates

## User Stories

### As a radiologist

1. **Upload a DICOM study**
   - I want to upload a folder containing DICOM files to the cloud
   - So that I can free up local storage space while keeping the study accessible
   
2. **Download a previously uploaded study**
   - I want to download a complete study using its Study UID
   - So that I can review the images on my local workstation

3. **Verify upload completeness**
   - I want confirmation that all files were successfully transferred
   - So that I can safely delete the local copies

### As an IT administrator

4. **Multi-threaded transfers**
   - I want to use multiple threads for file transfers
   - So that I can maximize bandwidth utilization and minimize transfer time

5. **Performance monitoring**
   - I want to see performance statistics for transfers
   - So that I can optimize network and hardware resources

6. **Secure transfers**
   - I want all data transfers to be encrypted
   - So that patient data remains secure and compliant with regulations

### As a developer

7. **Clean code organization**
   - I want the code to be well-organized and documented
   - So that I can maintain and extend it easily

8. **Error handling**
   - I want robust error handling and reporting
   - So that issues can be quickly identified and resolved
